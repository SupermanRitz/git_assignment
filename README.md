> a. What is an _issue_?

An issue are items that can be created in a respository to plan, track and discuss work.

> b. What is a _pull request_?
	
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch of a repository to another.

> c. How do I open up a _pull request_?

After making changes to a branch, adding and committing the changes, you can create a push call that 
will send the remote files to Github which will trigger to open a pull request. Alternatively you can create 
a pull request directly from Github using the navigation bar and the GUI	

> d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

	1. Go to the "Settings" of the target repository
	2. Under "Access" > "Collaborators"
	3. "Add people" button > add individuals by their GH username

> e. What is the difference between `git` and `GitHub`?

git is the tool that is used to interact with GitHub; the latter being the service that supports 
computer science/engineering work.

> f. What does `git diff` do?

'git diff' allows you see the changes you made to your working instance vs. your staging area 
(including position; row + column).
	

> g. What is the `main` branch?

The 'main' branch is the master/source branch of the repository that would contain all of the good, clean 
working code, files, data


> h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes 
directly into the `main` branch?

Pushing directly to a main branch is not good practice, this would introduce the possibility of pushing 
non-functional code to overwrite functional code without proper review and arbitration.
